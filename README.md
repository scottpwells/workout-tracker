  ## Usage
As a user I want to be able to log on to the fitness tracker application and then select new work out, add in whether or not I am doing a resistance work out or a cardio work out. Then I want to be able to enter in what type of resistance work out or cardio work out I am doing that day. For instance, if I was squating. I would select new work out, resistance work out and then I type in squats, the weight I am squating, and the amount of reps and I would add it to the fitness tracker, Then I should be able to view the details of my work out in the fitness dashboard.
