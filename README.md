  ## Usage
As a user I want to be able to log on to the fitness tracker application and create a new work out and then add in whether or not I am doing resistance work out or a cardio work out. Then I want to be able to add what type of resistance work out or cardio work out I am doing that day. For instance, Today I am squating. So I select new work out, resistance work out and then I type in squats, the weight I am squating, and the amount of reps and I add it to the fitness tracker, Then I can view the details of my work out in the fitness dashboard.
